Get all the pin information to the zynq fpga (part)
  This includes IOSTANDARD, SLEW, DRIVE, and LOC.
  Currently I have a table of the correct values for these in collateral/system.ucf and collateral/ps7_constraints.ucf
    Can I automatically generate this from something?

To be able to get *anything* running on the zynq you need to:
  Instantiate the ps7 module.
  Wire the MIO, PS_* and DDR_* signals from the ps7 instance to the top IO
  drive all other inputs to the ps7 instance to constants
    Specifically you need "stubs" on every unused axi port
